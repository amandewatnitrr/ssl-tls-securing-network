# Encryption and Hashing Overview

## Difference b/w HTTP and HTTPS

- HTTP: HyperText Transfer Protocol

  - It is a protocol used for transferring hypertext requests and information on the World Wide Web.
  - It is a stateless protocol, which means that the server does not keep any data (state) between two requests.
  - It uses port 80 for communication.
  - It is not secure, as the data is transferred in plain text.
  - It is faster than HTTPS.
  - It is used for websites that do not require sensitive information.

    For example, when visiting this site you will see a message visible at the top saying `Your connection to this site is not secure`. This is because the site is using HTTP instead of HTTPS.

- HTTPS: HyperText Transfer Protocol Secure

  - It is a secure version of HTTP.
  - It uses port 443 for communication.
  - It uses SSL/TLS to encrypt the data before transferring it.
  - It is slower than HTTP because of the encryption process.
  - It is used for websites that require sensitive information, such as online banking, e-commerce websites, etc.
  - It is more secure than HTTP.
  - It is stateless, just like HTTP.

## Hashing Overview

- Hashing is the process of converting an input (or 'message') into a fixed-length string of bytes.

- Encryption is done to make data unreadable by unauthorized users. Hashing is done to verify the integrity of data
- Hash is a fixed length string of bytes that is unique to the input. This length maybe 128, 256, 512 bits etc depending on the hashing algorithm used.
- Hashing is a one-way function, meaning that it is not possible to reverse the process and get the original input from the hash.
- Hashing is used in many applications, such as password storage, digital signatures, and data integrity verification.
- Hashing algorithms are designed to be fast and efficient, so they can be used in real-time applications.
- Some common hashing algorithms are MD5, SHA-1, SHA-256, and SHA-512.
- Hashing is not encryption. Encryption is a two-way function, meaning that it is possible to decrypt the data if you have the key.
- Hashing is used to verify the integrity of data, while encryption is used to make data unreadable by unauthorized users.
- Not all Hash have a key, encryption has a key.

  ```

- Workflow:

  - Sender:
    - The Sender inputs the data, which is passed to the Hash Function. 
  - Hash Function:
    - The Hash Function computes the hash from the data and generates a Hash.
  - Transmission:
    - The Sender transmits both the Data and the generated Hash to the Receiver.
  - Receiver:
    - The Receiver gets both the data and the hash.
    - The receiver then passes the received Data through the Hash Function to generate a new hash from the data.
  - Comparison:
    - The newly generated hash from the data is compared with the hash received.
    - If the hashes match, the integrity of the data is verified. If they don’t match, it indicates that the data might have been altered or corrupted during transmission.

- Hashes are created in a way that even a small change in the data will create a completely new hash, even depending on the time of change.
- Keys are used in Hashing to validate the integrity of the sender and receiver. The key is used to generate the hash and is shared between the sender and receiver.

### MD5 (Message Digest Algorithm 5) Hashing Algorithm

- MD5 is a widely used hashing algorithm that produces a 128-bit hash value.
- It is used to verify data integrity and is commonly used in digital signatures.
- It is not recommended for security purposes as it is vulnerable to collision attacks.
- A collision attack is when two different inputs produce the same hash value.
- MD5 is fast and efficient, making it suitable for real-time applications.
- Hashes generated by MD5 are unique to the input data, meaning that even a small change in the input will produce a completely different hash.
- MD5 is not encryption, as it is a one-way function that cannot be reversed to get the original input from the hash.
- Below is the example of MD5 Hashing algorith in action on Mac OS.

  If we make changes to this file `file.txt` and run the MD5 command again, we will get a different hash value, but the length of the hash will remain the same.

  The embedded MD5 Hashing Algorithm produces the hash value based on the content of the file.

### SHA (Secure Hash Algorithm) Hashing Algorithm

- SHA is a family of hashing algorithms that produce a fixed-length hash value.
- The most common SHA algorithms are SHA-1, SHA-256, and SHA-512.
- SHA-1 produces a 160-bit hash value, SHA-256 produces a 256-bit hash value, and SHA-512 produces a 512-bit hash value.
- SHA algorithms are used to verify data integrity and are commonly used in digital signatures.
- SHA-1 is no longer considered secure and is vulnerable to collision attacks.
- SHA-256 and SHA-512 are more secure and are recommended for security purposes.
- Hashes generated by SHA algorithms are unique to the input data, meaning that even a small change in the input will produce a completely different hash.
- Below is the implementation of SHA-256 Hashing Algorithm in action on Mac OS.

### HMAC (Hash-based Message Authentication Code)

- HMAC is a type of message authentication code that uses a cryptographic hash function to verify the integrity and authenticity of a message.
- It combines a secret key with the message to generate a hash value that is unique to not only input data but the key that comes with it.
- The other side will get the same hash if it has the same secret key.
- HMAC is used to prevent unauthorized users from tampering with the message or data.
- It is commonly used in network security protocols, such as SSL/TLS, IPsec, and SSH.
- HMAC is more secure than traditional message authentication codes because it uses a cryptographic hash function to generate the hash value.
- HMAC can be used with any cryptographic hash function, such as MD5, SHA-1, SHA-256, and SHA-512.
